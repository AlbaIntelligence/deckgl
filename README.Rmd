## Installation

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("deckgl")
```

You can install the latest version of r-deckgl from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("crazycapivara/deckgl")
```

```{r, child="vignettes/partials/_get-started"}
```

## Development

The JavaScript library of r-deckgl uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as module bundler. Therefore, you need [node.js](https://nodejs.org) to build the module. All JavaScript code is located in the `javascript/src` folder and test components go to `javascript/src/test-components`.

Install deps and build the library from inside the `javascript` folder with:

```bash
npm install

npm run build
```

To spin up the [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) run:

```bash
npm run start
```

If the `deckgl` widget is not visible in the viewer pane of RStudio, just open it in your browser by clicking "Show in new window" and everything will be fine.
